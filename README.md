## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Technologies Used

• HTML, SCSS, Javascript, AJAX, and jQuery

• Grunt serve and grunt deploy to manage development and production servers

• Git, Github, and Github Pages for version control

## What I have learned so far

• I have learned about better code management. Taking the process in stages, working on in the following order curl request, html, events, api, and ui.

• I have learned about authenticaton: when a user signs up, signs in, changes their password, and signs out.


## Unsolved Problems

• On newGame click, sometimes starts with a "O" when it should start with "X". It's a reproducable bug, but not consistant.

• A "nice to have", would be to display a message when user clicks already occupied box. Something like, 'try another box'.

## Wireframes

I had a three revisions of my wireframes. At the beginning I wasn't quite grasping the single-page concept as far as my sketches on paper were going.
