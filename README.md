## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Technologies Used

• HTML, SCSS, Javascript, AJAX, and jQuery

• Grunt serve and grunt deploy to manage development and production servers

• Git, Github, and Github Pages for version control

## What I have learned so far

Even though I know I will not make requirements at least by the first due date, I have learned a lot. When it comes to learning new technical skills I grasp the concepts a bit slow. I have to remind myself to slow down and read through the problem and eventually I will comprehend.

## Unsolved Problems

• Code better to have DRYer code by simplifing the the click events and if/else statements in the events.js file, by not repeating code in a long if/else statement

## Wireframes

I had a three revisions of my wireframes. At the beginning I wasn't quite grasping the single-page concept as far as my sketches on paper were going.
