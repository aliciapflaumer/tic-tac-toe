## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Technologies Used

• HTML, SCSS, Javascript, AJAX, jQuery, Bootstrap

• Grunt serve and grunt deploy to manage development and production servers

• Git, Github, and Github Pages for version control

## What I have learned so far

• As part of documenting my workflow, I used a progress chart consisting of each stage/step on paper, checking off each as I moved along. Accompanied with a to-do list created in atom and saved to my repo, where I would mark done when complete (that helped with bug fixes, too).

• I have learned about better code management. Taking the process in stages, working in the following order curl request, html, events, api, and ui.

• I have learned about CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

• I have learned about authenticaton: when a user signs up, signs in, changes their password, and signs out.

• I have learned that it's important to write detailed issues, so that the consultant team can have a better understanding of the problem and then skew me in the right direction without giving me the answer, but have me figure it out on my own.

## Unsolved Problems

• A "nice to have", to display a message when user clicks already occupied box. Something like, 'try another box'.

• A "nice to have", to display individual wins for each player and how many ties.

• I would like to have DRY code. I wrote my code not using a game array. I hand-coded a lot of it just to get the game to work, and because that's how it was making sense to me at the time to create the game (a very un-dry way).

## Wireframes

I had a three revisions of my wireframes. At the beginning I wasn't quite grasping the single-page concept as far as my sketches on paper were going.

## User Stories

• As a user, I want to sign in so that I can play the game.

• As a user, I want to sign up so that I can play the game.

• As a user, I want to click a box so that I can put an X or an O on the board.

• As a user, I want to click the button so that I can log out.

BONUS:

• As a user, I want to search for an opponent so that I can play against them.
